At this moment, in this quiet night
I drive the car aimlessly
You are sitting on my left side
Where your profile is illuminated by the moon
But, as we talk and our words weave together
Like we're searching and walking down the memory lane
Without being able to help it, the memories
Of those days come rushing out
Ever since the day I decided to live with you
Bit by bit, the world began to change
Back thеn, like I was strong, like I was hiding my weaknеss
I performed a persona
Up until one day, your gaze suddenly appeared and
Taught me something that I'd never known
By just having something that I want to protect
I'll become that much stronger
Within this deep, deep darkness
Came days incomparable to any other
Such as the day we met, and the times we spent together
They were comforting
Or rather, happy times
And for certain, you know
That was when I'd been saved
By you
Sparkling as if they captured faint light within
The tears as they dropped looked just like falling stars
Spilling over and flowing from this graceless life
Those tears looked so beautiful
The kindness strongly hidden in your large body
As well as your face that looked somehow in pain
I recall all of them fondly
It wasn't about your form or shape
I finally now realize
The ring of a gunshot cruelly tears into the night
As the breath of farewell rushes onward
The falling stars, without mercy, shine for just an instant
And disappear before my wishes can reach
Burning out within these hands
Is a gentle comet in the color of gold
A beautiful lion's mane
Which I tightly grasp, in the darkness
